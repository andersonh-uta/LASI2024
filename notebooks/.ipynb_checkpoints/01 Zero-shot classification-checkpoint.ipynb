    "# Preface: some libraries to know about\n",
    "\n",
    "[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)'s [various Python libraries](https://huggingface.co//docs) are probably the best place to get started with LLMs, and what we'll be using today.  There's also [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), which is quickly getting more and more popular, but we won't be covering it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the big libraries in the Huggingface ecosystem you should know about (click each library name to go to its documentation):\n",
    "- [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index): the library we'll be using.  General-purpose Transformer models for working with text.  (Almost all modern LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture).\n",
    "- [`diffusers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index): like `transformers`, but for diffusion models, which output images and videos.\n",
    "- [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index): provides various optimizations for running models in Huggingface's other libraries.\n",
    "- [`optimum`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index): provides various hardware-specific optimizations for Huggingface models.\n",
    "- [`gradio`](https://www.gradio.app/docs): dashboard library, focused on deploying machine learning applications (not just LLMs).\n",
    "- [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index): lots and lots of datasets to play with!\n",
    "- [`peft`](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index): provides various \"parameter-efficient fine-tuning\" methods that let you fine-tune big models with much lower RAM requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using just `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `datasets`.  We'll also use the PyTorch models in `transformers`, though there are also Tensorflow and JAX models, and some `transformers`-specific training tools.  Feel free to explore those on your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to `scikit-learn` (from the last example), training PyTorch models takes more code.  None of it is particularly complicated, or particularly difficult.  The hard parts will be all the stuff around the code, rather than the code itself.\n",

    "# Zero-shot classification with generative models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some major caveats and warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models--while very cool, and shockingly good at doing one-shot and zero-shot learning, _should not be used blindly._  There are some _major_ concerns around their use.  A non-exhaustive list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data privacy.\n",
    "    1. if you're using a model that isn't hosted locally, be sure you know their data privacy policies.  Uploading data to ChatGPT could be a violation of IRB protocols or data privacy laws.\n",
    "    2. This is not an issue if you're hosting the the mode entirely locally.\n",
    "3. Reproducibility.\n",
    "    1. The same prompt won't always give the same results.  _This is the models working as they are supposed to.  It is impossible to fully prevent this behavior._  \n",
    "    2. With local models you can set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.  _But reproducibility and correctness are not the same thing._\n",
    "    3. Web-hosted models like ChatGPT might undergo significant changes with no notice.\n",
    "4. Hallucinations.\n",
    "    1. Generative models _are designed to hallucinate._  It is _mathematically impossible_ to prevent this without crippling the models.\n",
    "    2. If accuracy is critical, _do not use these results without verifying them._  (At which point, you might not be saving yourself any work).\n",
    "5. Output formats.\n",
    "    1. Text-to-text models don't reliably produce machine-readable outputs.  You may have to do a lot of manual work or post-processing to convert text outputs into a machine-readable format, e.g. to do a statistical analysis on them.\n",
    "6. Context windows.\n",
    "    1. LLMs can only \"remember\" so much text.  This is less of an issue now than it used to be, but for very long texts, you may have to find a way to work around this limitation.\n",
    "7. Instability.\n",
    "    1. Small changes to your prompts might result in different outputs for each document.\n",
    "    2. It is not possible to reason about how changes to the input will affect the output; these models are black boxes.\n",
    "8. Cost.\n",
    "    1. Generative LLMs aren't free.  They require _very_ high compute resources to run efficiently.  You're either buying GPUs, renting compute from somewhere like AWS, or paying a per-token price for API calls to something like ChatGPT.  This can get very expensive very quickly for some projects.\n",
    "8. Factual accuracy.\n",
    "   1. _LLMs do not have a notion of factual accuracy._  They only compute a _probable_ continuation of the text, _based on their training data_.  This can result in output that has the form of a factually true statement, _but the model is not aware of \"factual accuracy\" in either the inputs or outputs._\n",
    "9. Meta-linguistic references and math.\n",
    "    1. Generative models are consistently _awful_ at doing math, or at \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models are not magic, they are not oracles, they are not universal problem solvers, they are not knowledge bases.  They are tools that generate text that looks like their training data.  Everything else they can do, while extremely impressive and very interesting, _is a happy accident._\n",
    "\n",
    "_However,_ they still have some very compelling and interesting use cases.  We'll explore one of them here: zero-shot classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Zero-Shot Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Zero-shot classification\" = making predictions by describing the task, or describing the different categories, without providing labeled data.  Zero-shot classification is _hard_, but LLMs are surprisingly good at it--with some important caveats that we'll see in a bit.  Generative LLMs in particular show a lot of promise for this kind of application, which is where we'l focus for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data and prediction task\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to keep it simple, we'll do a classic sentiment analysis task.  We'll pull a dataset of Yelp reviews, keep only the 1 and 5 star reviews, and ask a model to predict if this is a positive (5-star) or negative (1-star) review.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're intentionally keeping it simple for this workshop; you can use the same general steps we show here with far more complicated tasks, but the general design of the code won't change much."

(Other tricks might work better depending on your specific hardware, but this allows us to run the models with very low VRAM usage).\n",

It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

      "TEXT: Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n",

      "TEXT: To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \\n\\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \\n\\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.\n",

      "TEXT: The words \\\"epic fail\\\" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\\n\\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\\n\\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\\n\\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\\n\\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\\n\\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me.\n",

      "TEXT: I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\\n\\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \\n\\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.\n",

    "The above answers will be a bit worse than they could be for a few reasons:\n",
    "- The models we used have 7 billion parameters.  This is on the small side for most generative models.  Larger models might give more consistent results, but be _extremely_ difficult to actually run.  And extremely slow.\n",
    "- Quantization can effect text generation a bit more than other tasks.  Text generation is a lot more sensitive to initial conditions.  (this is likely not a _huge_ effect\n",
    "- We didn't do a whole lot with prompt engineering.  E.g., we didn't provide a \"system\" message, which might have provided better results.\n",
    "- We didn't tweak any of the generation options, like the `temperature` or `top_k` values (we left these at the defaults).\n",
    "- Other models than Zephyr might give better results.  Mistral v0.3-instruct and Llama-3 might be good candidates to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do a few things with these results.  We could use them to jump-start a classifier model, or use them as suggestions for a human coder working through a lot of data (spot-checking can be easier than labelling from scratch!)."
