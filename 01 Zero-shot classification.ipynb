    "# Preface: some libraries to know about\n",
    "\n",
    "[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)'s [various Python libraries](https://huggingface.co//docs) are probably the best place to get started with LLMs, and what we'll be using today.  There's also [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), which is quickly getting more and more popular, but we won't be covering it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the big libraries in the Huggingface ecosystem you should know about (click each library name to go to its documentation):\n",
    "- [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index): the library we'll be using.  General-purpose Transformer models for working with text.  (Almost all modern LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture).\n",
    "- [`diffusers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index): like `transformers`, but for diffusion models, which output images and videos.\n",
    "- [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index): provides various optimizations for running models in Huggingface's other libraries.\n",
    "- [`optimum`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index): provides various hardware-specific optimizations for Huggingface models.\n",
    "- [`gradio`](https://www.gradio.app/docs): dashboard library, focused on deploying machine learning applications (not just LLMs).\n",
    "- [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index): lots and lots of datasets to play with!\n",
    "- [`peft`](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index): provides various \"parameter-efficient fine-tuning\" methods that let you fine-tune big models with much lower RAM requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using just `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `datasets`.  We'll also use the PyTorch models in `transformers`, though there are also Tensorflow and JAX models, and some `transformers`-specific training tools.  Feel free to explore those on your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to `scikit-learn` (from the last example), training PyTorch models takes more code.  None of it is particularly complicated, or particularly difficult.  The hard parts will be all the stuff around the code, rather than the code itself.\n",

    "# Zero-shot classification with generative models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some major caveats and warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models--while very cool, and shockingly good at doing one-shot and zero-shot learning, _should not be used blindly._  There are some _major_ concerns around their use.  A non-exhaustive list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data privacy.\n",
    "    1. if you're using a model that isn't hosted locally, be sure you know their data privacy policies.  Uploading data to ChatGPT could be a violation of IRB protocols or data privacy laws.\n",
    "    2. This is not an issue if you're hosting the the mode entirely locally.\n",
    "3. Reproducibility.\n",
    "    1. The same prompt won't always give the same results.  _This is the models working as they are supposed to.  It is impossible to fully prevent this behavior._  \n",
    "    2. With local models you can set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.  _But reproducibility and correctness are not the same thing._\n",
    "    3. Web-hosted models like ChatGPT might undergo significant changes with no notice.\n",
    "4. Hallucinations.\n",
    "    1. Generative models _are designed to hallucinate._  It is _mathematically impossible_ to prevent this without crippling the models.\n",
    "    2. If accuracy is critical, _do not use these results without verifying them._  (At which point, you might not be saving yourself any work).\n",
    "5. Output formats.\n",
    "    1. Text-to-text models don't reliably produce machine-readable outputs.  You may have to do a lot of manual work or post-processing to convert text outputs into a machine-readable format, e.g. to do a statistical analysis on them.\n",
    "6. Context windows.\n",
    "    1. LLMs can only \"remember\" so much text.  This is less of an issue now than it used to be, but for very long texts, you may have to find a way to work around this limitation.\n",
    "7. Instability.\n",
    "    1. Small changes to your prompts might result in different outputs for each document.\n",
    "    2. It is not possible to reason about how changes to the input will affect the output; these models are black boxes.\n",
    "8. Cost.\n",
    "    1. Generative LLMs aren't free.  They require _very_ high compute resources to run efficiently.  You're either buying GPUs, renting compute from somewhere like AWS, or paying a per-token price for API calls to something like ChatGPT.  This can get very expensive very quickly for some projects.\n",
    "8. Factual accuracy.\n",
    "   1. _LLMs do not have a notion of factual accuracy._  They only compute a _probable_ continuation of the text, _based on their training data_.  This can result in output that has the form of a factually true statement, _but the model is not aware of \"factual accuracy\" in either the inputs or outputs._\n",
    "9. Meta-linguistic references and math.\n",
    "    1. Generative models are consistently _awful_ at doing math, or at \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models are not magic, they are not oracles, they are not universal problem solvers, they are not knowledge bases.  They are tools that generate text that looks like their training data.  Everything else they can do, while extremely impressive and very interesting, _is a happy accident._\n",
    "\n",
    "_However,_ they still have some very compelling and interesting use cases.  We'll explore one of them here: zero-shot classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Zero-Shot Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Zero-shot classification\" = making predictions by describing the task, or describing the different categories, without providing labeled data.  Zero-shot classification is _hard_, but LLMs are surprisingly good at it--with some important caveats that we'll see in a bit.  Generative LLMs in particular show a lot of promise for this kind of application, which is where we'l focus for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data and prediction task\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to keep it simple, we'll do a classic sentiment analysis task.  We'll pull a dataset of Yelp reviews, keep only the 1 and 5 star reviews, and ask a model to predict if this is a positive (5-star) or negative (1-star) review.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're intentionally keeping it simple for this workshop; you can use the same general steps we show here with far more complicated tasks, but the general design of the code won't change much."

It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \\n\\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

    "The above answers will be a bit worse than they could be for a few reasons:\n",
    "- The models we used have 7 billion parameters.  This is on the small side for most generative models.  Larger models might give more consistent results, but be _extremely_ difficult to actually run.  And extremely slow.\n",
    "- Quantization can effect text generation a bit more than other tasks.  Text generation is a lot more sensitive to initial conditions.  (this is likely not a _huge_ effect\n",
    "- We didn't do a whole lot with prompt engineering.  E.g., we didn't provide a \"system\" message, which might have provided better results.\n",
    "- We didn't tweak any of the generation options, like the `temperature` or `top_k` values (we left these at the defaults).\n",
    "- Other models than Zephyr might give better results.  Mistral v0.3-instruct and Llama-3 might be good candidates to try.\n",

    "We could do a few things with these results.  We could use them to jump-start a classifier model, or use them as suggestions for a human coder working through a lot of data (spot-checking can be easier than labelling from scratch!)."
